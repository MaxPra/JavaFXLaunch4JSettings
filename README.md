# JavaFXLaunch4JSettings
Settings for JavaFx to create a EXE-File

# Instruction:
1. Replace "YourExe.exe" with the name you wante the EXE to have.
2. Replace YourJar.jar with the Jar, you want to make the EXE out.
3. If you want an icon, you can choose one, if not, just delete "YourIcon.ico".
4. In the "Command line args" you have to replace "YourJar" with the name of your jar.
5. In the Tab "jre" you have to enter the name of your jre folder, you want (Basic Launch4J stuff, doesn't have to do with JavaFX).
6. You have to name the folder, where the JFX library is in, "JFX".
7. You're done! :)

The JFX-library and the JRE have to be in the same folder as the executable!

#Have fun with it!
